# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with TypeORM & Express.js

Implement an RBAC system using TypeORM and Express.js, where users have roles, and each role has its set of permissions.

- Basic knowledge of TypeScript

## 2. Project Initialization

npm init -y
npm install express typeorm mysql2 reflect-metadata
npm install -D @types/node @types/express typescript ts-node
## 3. Define Entities
